# The "bridge" library is a sample library illustrating how to access

# array of x/y floating point pairs and back.

# To build this module externally you'll need to supply these variables in
# qmake:
#  - KLAYOUTINCLUDE: path to the KLayout sources
#  - KLAYOUTLIBDIR: path to the KLayout libraries (.so/.dll)
#  - PYTHONINCLUDE: path to the Python include file
#  - PYTHONLIBFILE: path to the Python library file
#
# Normally, these paths are set by the build script.

# To use the bridge library, ...
